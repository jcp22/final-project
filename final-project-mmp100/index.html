        <p>The first thing to know is that you are not alone. A 2006 study, conducted by researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, found that nearly half of the 236 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the study experienced emotional symptoms and distress that were clinically significant. This means that these patients, rather than having a passing case of the blues, meet established screening criteria for severe emotional distress or psychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p>Severe emotional distress is the most common mental health issue among breast cancer patients and was experienced by 41% of the 236 participants in the Dartmouth study. It can be difficult to distinguish between the normal, healthy reaction to a cancer diagnosis and severe emotional distress. But a simple questionnaire known as the "Distress Thermometer" has been endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as a way to determine whether emotional distress is significantly affecting your life.</p>
